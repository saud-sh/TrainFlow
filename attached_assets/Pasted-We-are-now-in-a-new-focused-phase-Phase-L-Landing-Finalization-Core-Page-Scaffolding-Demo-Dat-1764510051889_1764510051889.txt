We are now in a new focused phase:

Phase L – Landing Finalization, Core Page Scaffolding & Demo Data Boost

You MUST follow the Interoris protocol and the existing TrainFlow blueprint in replit.md.
No destructive DB changes. No schema edits. No auth changes. Frontend + Seed only.

====================================================
A. CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
====================================================

- DO NOT modify database schema or Alembic migrations.
- DO NOT change authentication flow (Replit Auth + existing backend auth).
- DO NOT remove or rename existing routes, tables, or core services.
- DO NOT introduce destructive DB operations (no DROP/ALTER DROP).
- All changes MUST be additive and fully backward compatible.

Focus ONLY on:
- Frontend landing components
- Frontend dashboard pages that currently give 404
- Seed data function(s) in backend/app/seeds/demo_seed.py
- Documentation in replit.md (if needed)

====================================================
B. OBJECTIVE 1 – Landing Page Finalization (EN + AR)
====================================================

Goal: The public landing page (home page before login) should look production-grade and fully bilingual, using the content already defined in i18n/en.ts and i18n/ar.ts.

Tasks:

1) Locate the landing entry component:
   - e.g. frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx or equivalent.
   - Make sure it is the component rendered for the root path ("/") for unauthenticated users.

2) Ensure the landing page is composed of:
   - Hero section
   - Core capabilities / features grid
   - Workflow section (8 steps)
   - AI capabilities section
   - Enterprise / integrations section
   - KPI / metrics section
   - Security & compliance section
   - FAQ
   - Footer

3) For each landing sub-component:
   - frontend/src/components/landing/Hero.tsx
   - frontend/src/components/landing/Features.tsx
   - frontend/src/components/landing/Workflow.tsx
   - frontend/src/components/landing/AI.tsx
   - frontend/src/components/landing/Enterprise.tsx
   - frontend/src/components/landing/Integrations.tsx
   - frontend/src/components/landing/Security.tsx
   - frontend/src/components/landing/FAQ.tsx
   or equivalent files,

   You MUST:

   - Wire all visible text to the existing i18n keys in frontend/src/i18n/en.ts and ar.ts.
   - DO NOT hardcode English or Arabic strings in JSX.
   - Use the updated content: 12 features, 8 workflow steps, 5 AI items, 6 FAQs.

4) Fix the issues you previously mentioned:
   - Features.tsx: expand icons/array to handle **12** features (not just 10).
   - Workflow.tsx: layout/grid must support **8** workflow steps (not 7).
   - AI.tsx: icons/cards array must support **5** AI capabilities (not 4).

5) UX / UI requirements:
   - Keep using Tailwind, ShadCN UI and Framer Motion as already implemented.
   - Ensure the page is fully responsive (mobile → desktop).
   - Ensure the Arabic version uses RTL layout (html dir="rtl" or equivalent wrapper).
   - Ensure language switcher correctly flips EN/AR and LTR/RTL.
   - Make the hero section “more complete”:
     * Clear title + subtitle
     * Two CTA buttons (Get Started / Sign In or Request Demo)
     * Subtext that mentions Aramco / Saudi Electricity as target-type customers, but generic (do not claim actual partnership).

Deliverable for Objective 1:
- A visually complete landing page that shows all sections and content for BOTH languages, with no cut-off items or missing icons.

====================================================
C. OBJECTIVE 2 – Core Dashboard Pages (Fix 404s)
====================================================

Currently, some routes show "404 Page Not Found":
- /profile
- /settings
- /team  (or /departments depending on the blueprint)
- /approvals/:id (e.g., /approvals/2)

Goal: Provide working pages (even if minimal at first) so that users no longer see the 404 placeholder.

Tasks:

1) Router inspection:
   - Open the main router configuration (e.g. frontend/src/router.tsx, or AppRoutes, or where React Router is configured).
   - Identify routes for:
     * Profile
     * Settings
     * Team / Departments
     * Approvals list and approval details

2) Create or update the following page components under frontend/src/pages/ (or the folder that matches the blueprint):

   - ProfilePage.tsx
   - SettingsPage.tsx
   - TeamPage.tsx or DepartmentsPage.tsx (name according to the existing navigation label)
   - ApprovalDetailsPage.tsx (dynamic route with :id)

   Each page MUST:
   - Use the existing layout (sidebar + topbar) via the shared layout component.
   - Use ShadCN UI components for cards, forms and tables.
   - Use i18n text for headings and labels (EN/AR).
   - Show realistic placeholder content now (do NOT leave them empty), for example:

     Profile:
       - shows user name, email, role, department (from the auth context or /api/auth/me).
       - basic info cards (read-only in this phase).

     Settings:
       - notification preferences (toggles only, no backend change required yet).
       - language preference (sync with current i18n setting).
       - theme preference (light/dark if already supported).

     Team / Departments:
       - table of departments and members using existing APIs if available (e.g. /api/departments, /api/users?departmentId=…).
       - If backend endpoints are not fully implemented yet, use mocked data that matches the demo seed (ERTMD, TMSD, JTMD) but keep the code ready to switch to API later.

     ApprovalDetails:
       - route: /approvals/:id
       - show summary of a renewal request (employee, course, status, timestamps).
       - Use existing approvals/renewals API if already present, or create a placeholder component that reads the :id param and displays mock data while keeping the structure ready.

3) Router wiring:
   - Register all these pages in the routing configuration so that:
     - /profile → ProfilePage
     - /settings → SettingsPage
     - /team or /departments → TeamPage/DepartmentsPage
     - /approvals/:id → ApprovalDetailsPage

4) Error handling:
   - Ensure these pages do NOT show the generic 404 component anymore.
   - If an API request fails, show a friendly error state inside the page (ShadCN Alert) instead of the global 404.

Deliverable for Objective 2:
- Navigating to /profile, /settings, /team (or /departments), and /approvals/2 from the sidebar or links MUST show a real page (not 404) with proper layout and bilingual labels.

====================================================
D. OBJECTIVE 3 – Demo Data Boost (Seed Enhancements)
====================================================

Goal: Increase the richness of demo data so that the dashboards and new pages feel realistic in production demos, WITHOUT touching schema.

You MUST work only inside:
- backend/app/seeds/demo_seed.py
(or the existing demo seed module documented in replit.md).

Constraints:
- Seed MUST remain **idempotent**: calling it multiple times must not duplicate records.
- DO NOT alter models or migrations.
- DO NOT change primary keys or schema.

Tasks:

1) Read the current demo_seed implementation and understand:
   - How tenants, departments, users, courses, enrollments, renewals, tasks, KPIs and notifications are seeded.

2) Enhance the data while keeping it idempotent:
   - Add more enrollments per employee (e.g., 3–5 courses per employee with different statuses: completed, in-progress, failed, expired, expiring soon).
   - Add more renewal requests with different statuses (pending, approved, rejected).
   - Add more notifications so the notification center feels active.
   - Add more KPI snapshots per department over multiple dates (for charts and trends).
   - Ensure departments seeded (ERTMD, TMSD, JTMD) have employees across different roles (foreman, manager, employee).

3) Keep logic tenant-safe:
   - Everything seeded MUST belong to the demo tenant.
   - Do NOT create cross-tenant data.

4) Update the response of the /api/v1/users/seed-demo endpoint (if needed) to include the new counts (e.g., number of enrollments, renewals, notifications, KPI snapshots).

Deliverable for Objective 3:
- Calling /api/v1/users/seed-demo as admin will populate a rich, realistic dataset without duplicates, ideal for demos.

====================================================
E. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
====================================================

1) Landing Page:
   - All sections render correctly in EN and AR.
   - 12 features visible with icons.
   - 8 workflow steps visible.
   - 5 AI items visible.
   - No "stubs" or obviously empty sections.

2) Pages no longer 404:
   - /profile shows actual profile info.
   - /settings shows real settings UI.
   - /team or /departments shows at least a basic departments/team list.
   - /approvals/:id shows an approval details page (even if partly mocked).

3) Demo Data:
   - /api/v1/users/seed-demo runs successfully multiple times with no duplicates.
   - After seeding, dashboards and pages display sufficiently rich data to show the system capabilities.

4) Non-functional:
   - No backend schema changes.
   - No destructive DB operations.
   - No breaking of existing routes or API contracts.

After completing, summarize:
- Which files were changed.
- What new pages/routes were added.
- What demo data was added.
- How to test each of the new pages and the seed.
