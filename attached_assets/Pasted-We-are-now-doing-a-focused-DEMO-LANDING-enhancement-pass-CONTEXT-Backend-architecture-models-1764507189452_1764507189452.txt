We are now doing a focused DEMO & LANDING enhancement pass.

CONTEXT:
- Backend architecture, models, migrations, and core APIs already exist.
- Frontend landing page, i18n (en/ar), and components already exist and are functional.
- We MUST NOT change the schema in a destructive way.
- We MUST keep all previous architecture decisions intact.

GOAL OF THIS ROUND (TWO PARTS):

1) Add a full DEMO SEED for all main features (backend).
2) Refine and enrich the LANDING PAGE copy and structure in both Arabic and English (frontend).

You must follow Interoris rules:
- NO destructive migrations (no DROP TABLE/COLUMN, no ALTER DROP).
- Seed data MUST be additive, idempotent, and tenant-aware.
- Multi-tenant isolation MUST be respected (tenant_id for all business rows).
- RBAC MUST be respected (only admin can trigger seed).

====================================================
PART 1 – DEMO SEED DATA (BACKEND)
====================================================

Implement a DEMO SEED mechanism that:

- Is idempotent (calling it twice does not duplicate data).
- Creates a full demo scenario across all core modules.
- Is restricted to ADMIN users only.

A) LOCATION & ENTRYPOINT

1) Create `backend/app/seeds/demo_seed.py` with a `run_demo_seed(db)` function.

2) Create a protected admin endpoint in a suitable router (e.g. admin or users, or a dedicated router), for example:

`POST /api/v1/admin/seed-demo`

Behavior:
- Requires role = "admin".
- Calls `run_demo_seed(db)`.
- Returns a summary of what was created.

B) DEMO DATA CONTENT

Inside `run_demo_seed(db)` you must:

1) DEMO TENANT
- If a tenant with slug "democorp" already exists → return without creating duplicates.
- Else create:
  - name: "DemoCorp"
  - slug: "democorp"
  - is_active: True

2) DEPARTMENTS
Under DemoCorp tenant, create departments such as:
- "ERTMD"  (Emergency Response Training & Maintenance Department)
- "TMSD"   (Technical Maintenance & Support Department)
- "JTMD"   (Job Training & Development Department)

3) USERS & ROLES
Create users under DemoCorp tenant:

- 1 Admin:
  - email: admin@democorp.local
  - role: admin

- 1 Training Officer:
  - email: training.officer@democorp.local
  - role: training_officer

- 2 Managers:
  - manager1@democorp.local
  - manager2@democorp.local
  - role: manager

- 3 Foremen:
  - foreman1@democorp.local
  - foreman2@democorp.local
  - foreman3@democorp.local
  - role: foreman

- ~8–10 Employees:
  - employee1..N@democorp.local
  - role: employee

Use a sensible default password (e.g. "TrainFlow123!" – do NOT log it in plain text, just document it in replit.md).  
Assign departments and supervisors according to the organizational hierarchy (employees under foremen, foremen under managers).

4) COURSES
Create a realistic course catalog for DemoCorp tenant, e.g.:

- "Basic Safety Orientation"              (validity_days=365, mandatory)
- "Electrical Safety Level 2"             (validity_days=365, mandatory)
- "First Aid & CPR"                       (validity_days=730, mandatory)
- "SCADA Fundamentals"                    (validity_days=730, optional)
- "Cyber Security Awareness"              (validity_days=365, mandatory)
- "Confined Space Entry"                  (validity_days=365, optional)
- "Emergency Response Leadership"         (validity_days=730, managers-only)

Link each course to one of the departments and set proper categories/types.

5) ENROLLMENTS
For each employee:

- Create a mix of enrollments so that:
  - Some are COMPLETED with future expiry dates.
  - Some are ACTIVE and in-progress.
  - Some are EXPIRED (expiry_date < today).
  - Some are expiring in 30/14/7/1 days (for testing alerts).

Set:
- status (active/completed/failed/expired)
- start_date, completion_date, expiry_date

6) RENEWAL REQUESTS & WORKFLOW LOG
For several expired / expiring enrollments:

- Create renewal_requests with different states:
  - Pending (no approver yet)
  - Approved (by foreman/manager)
  - Rejected (with decision_comment)

- For approved/rejected ones, also create:
  - workflow_steps records (who approved, at which level).
  - workflow_logs entries representing timeline actions.

7) PROGRESSION TASKS & EMPLOYEE TASKS
Create progression_tasks for at least 2–3 grade levels (e.g. "G5", "G6", "G7"):

- For each grade, define 3–5 tasks:
  - Example: "Complete Advanced Safety Course", "Lead Toolbox Talk", "Perform Field Audit", etc.

Create employee_tasks for some employees:
- Some tasks marked completed with completed_at.
- Some in_progress.
- Some not_started.

8) NOTIFICATIONS
Generate realistic notifications for DemoCorp users, e.g.:

- Upcoming expiry notices (30/14/7/1 days)
- Renewal approved / rejected
- Task assigned / completed
- KPI alerts

Mark some as read, others unread.

9) KPI SNAPSHOTS
Create KPI snapshot entries for:

- A few employees (employee-level metrics)
- A few foremen (team-level metrics)
- A manager (department-level metrics)
- Training officer (global training metrics)

Metrics examples:
- "training_completion_rate"
- "expired_course_ratio"
- "task_completion_rate"
- "promotion_readiness_score"

10) OPTIONAL – INTEGRATIONS SAMPLE
If integration tables exist (integration_configs, etc.), create sample rows:

- provider: "sap"
- provider: "oracle"
- provider: "cornerstone"
Set them as inactive sample configs.

11) OPTIONAL – AI RECOMMENDATIONS
If ai_recommendations table exists, add a few static demo recommendations for some employees (just to demo UI if wired).

C) AUDIT LOGGING
For seed operations that simulate real actions (e.g. approvals), it is good to optionally log a few entries into audit_logs with a "seed_demo" flag.

D) DOCUMENTATION
Update `replit.md`:

- Document:
  - Demo tenant slug: democorp
  - Demo logins (emails + roles)
  - Default password (without logging it anywhere else)
- Explain how to call:
  - `POST /api/v1/admin/seed-demo` (and required auth/role).

====================================================
PART 2 – LANDING PAGE COPY & CONTENT ENHANCEMENT
====================================================

Now refine and enrich the existing landing page:

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT break the current layout/components.
- DO NOT remove existing animations.
- Only enhance / extend content and structure within the existing design.

Use the existing i18n system (`en.ts`, `ar.ts`) and update texts so that they:

1) Explain TrainFlow as a **Talent & Training Intelligence Platform** not only training renewal.

2) Cover these topics clearly in BOTH languages:

- Training Management & Renewals:
  - “Manage validity, expiry, and renewals of all corporate trainings.”
  - AR: "إدارة صلاحية الدورات، مراقبة الانتهاء، وتسيير طلبات التجديد للموظفين."

- Multi-Level Approval Workflow:
  - From employee → foreman → manager → training officer.
  - AR: "مسار اعتماد متعدد المستويات من الموظف إلى المشرف إلى المدير ثم مسؤول التدريب."

- Task & Promotion Engine:
  - Grade-based tasks and promotion readiness.
  - AR: "محرك مهام للترقية مبني على المستوى الوظيفي ونِسَب الإنجاز."

- KPI & Analytics:
  - Employee KPIs, team KPIs, department KPIs, training compliance dashboards.
  - AR: "لوحات مؤشرات للموظف، الفريق، والإدارة، مع قياس جاهزية التدريب والالتزام."

- AI Features:
  - AI Course Recommendations.
  - Grade Prediction (promotion readiness).
  - AI Coaching (weekly suggestions for skills and courses).
  - Skill Gap Detection / Skill Graph.
  - AR: صياغة واضحة لهذه العناصر بالأسلوب العربي الرسمي.

- Integrations:
  - SAP HR / TEM, Oracle HCM, SuccessFactors, Cornerstone LMS, and custom DB connectors.
  - AR: "تكامل أصلي مع أنظمة الموارد البشرية وأنظمة إدارة التعلم مثل SAP و Oracle و SuccessFactors و Cornerstone."

- Security & Enterprise Readiness:
  - Multi-tenant isolation.
  - RBAC.
  - JWT + HttpOnly cookies.
  - Audit logs.
  - Background jobs.
  - AR: صياغة بسيطة ولكن احترافية تذكر الأمن والحوكمة.

3) Hero Section Text:

Update hero text in both languages to match new positioning:

EN:
- Title: “TrainFlow – AI-Powered Training, Renewal & Talent Intelligence Platform”
- Subtitle: “Designed for enterprises like Aramco and Saudi Electricity Company to automate training validity, renewals, promotion readiness, and skill intelligence.”

AR:
- Title: "TrainFlow – منصة التدريب والتجديد وذكاء المواهب المدعومة بالذكاء الاصطناعي"
- Subtitle: "مصممة للمنظمات الكبرى مثل أرامكو والشركة السعودية للكهرباء لأتمتة صلاحية الدورات، طلبات التجديد، جاهزية الترقية، وتحليل المهارات."

4) Features / Modules Section:

Ensure each card has:
- A strong English title + description.
- A matching Arabic title + description.

Include cards for:
- Training Renewal Workflow
- Multi-level Approvals
- Progression & Promotion Engine
- KPI & Compliance Dashboards
- AI Talent Intelligence
- LMS & ERP Integrations
- Security Awareness Simulator (if implemented/later)
- Skill Passport / Skill Graph

5) Workflow Section:

Make the steps explicitly bilingual in i18n:
- Assign course
- Track validity
- Detect expiry
- Employee receives alerts
- Creates renewal request
- Foreman/Manager approval
- Training Officer schedules
- KPIs update

Provide equivalent Arabic steps.

6) FAQ Section:

Update FAQ entries to answer questions like:
- How does TrainFlow integrate with our existing HR system?
- Can we import employees and training history from our current LMS?
- How does AI recommendation work?
- Is TrainFlow multi-tenant and secure?
- Is the platform suitable for government and regulated industries?
- How long does it take to implement?

Provide answers in both languages via i18n.

7) RTL/LTR CHECK:

Ensure when Arabic is selected:
- Page direction is RTL.
- Text looks natural and properly aligned.
- No layout breaks.

====================================================
FINAL VALIDATION
====================================================

When you finish:

1) BACKEND:
   - Ensure `run_demo_seed` can be called via `POST /api/v1/admin/seed-demo`.
   - It must be idempotent (safe to call multiple times).
   - It must populate ALL main tables with realistic demo data.
   - It must respect tenant_id and RBAC (admin-only).

2) FRONTEND:
   - Landing page loads for both English and Arabic.
   - Language switcher updates all new/updated sections.
   - Hero, Features, Workflow, AI, Integrations, Security, FAQ, Footer — all reflect the richer descriptions.
   - Layout and animations remain smooth and responsive.

3) DOCUMENT:
   - Update `replit.md` with:
     - How to trigger demo seed.
     - List of demo users (emails and roles) + note about default password.
     - Short note about landing page structure & i18n keys touched.

STOP after completing these tasks and provide a clear summary of:
- Seed data content (counts per entity).
- Updated landing sections.
- How to log in as demo users and explore the seeded data.
