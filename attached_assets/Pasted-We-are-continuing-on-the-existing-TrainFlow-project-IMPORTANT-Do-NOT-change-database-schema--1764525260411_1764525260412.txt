We are continuing on the existing TrainFlow project.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT change database schema.
- Do NOT touch Alembic or migrations.
- Do NOT change backend auth (/api/v1/users/login, /api/v1/users/me) – they are already working.
- Do NOT change any RBAC or role-based protections.
- Do NOT change sidebar items or route guards.

The ONLY change I want in this phase:
- After a successful login, ALWAYS redirect the user to **/dashboard**, regardless of their role.
- The sidebar and route guards should continue to behave exactly as they do now (show/hide items based on role, enforce 403 on forbidden routes).

--------------------------------
1) Login redirect behavior
--------------------------------

Current behavior:
- After login, the login page uses a helper like getDefaultRouteForRole(user.role)
  to navigate admins to /users, managers to /kpi-dashboard, etc.

Required behavior:
- Ignore role-based redirect for now.
- After successful login, always do:

  navigate('/dashboard', { replace: true })

- The sidebar will still adapt based on the user role (admin sees admin sections, employee sees personal sections), but the FIRST page after login should always be /dashboard.

Implementation details:

1. Open file:
   - client/src/pages/login.tsx

2. In the login submit handler (after a successful login):

   - Remove or stop using getDefaultRouteForRole(user.role).
   - Instead, after login() resolves successfully and auth state is refreshed, call:
     navigate('/dashboard', { replace: true });

   - Keep the small delay (if needed) only to ensure the cookie/session is saved,
     but final redirect target must be "/dashboard" for all roles.

3. Do NOT change:
   - useAuth hook.
   - ProtectedRoute component.
   - roleRoutes mapping.
   - Sidebar component logic.

Those should remain as they are. They will still control what each user can see and access:

- Employee will still only see employee routes in the sidebar.
- Admin will still see admin routes (users, departments, integrations, audit-logs, etc.).
- If a user manually visits a route they are not allowed to (e.g., employee -> /users), they should still get 403.

--------------------------------
2) Route behavior to keep
--------------------------------

- / = public landing page (EN/AR, animations, etc.).
- /login = login page.
- /dashboard = the common post-login home for ALL roles.
- All other routes remain protected and role-guarded as they are now.

--------------------------------
3) Acceptance criteria
--------------------------------

After you make this change:

1) When I log in as:
   - admin@democorp.local / TrainFlow123!
   - manager1@democorp.local / TrainFlow123!
   - foreman1@democorp.local / TrainFlow123!
   - employee1@democorp.local / TrainFlow123!

   I should always be redirected to **/dashboard**.

2) On /dashboard:
   - The cards, stats, and sidebar must change according to the role.
   - Admin still sees admin menu.
   - Employee still sees only employee features.

3) If I manually open:
   - /users as employee → I should see an Access Denied / 403 view.
   - /users as admin → I can access normally.

Please implement only this redirect change and keep everything else exactly the same.
