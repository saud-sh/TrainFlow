We are starting a NEW SESSION.

You have ALREADY diagnosed the issue:

- ACTIVE frontend: client/
- New enterprise landing page: in frontend/src/*
- Result: training.rocktech.sa still shows the old simple landing.

Your task in THIS SESSION ONLY:

PHASE L2 – CONSOLIDATE LANDING INTO client/ (FRONTEND ONLY)

-------------------------------------------------------
A) HARD LIMITS – DO NOT TOUCH
-------------------------------------------------------
- Do NOT touch backend (FastAPI, Python) files.
- Do NOT touch Alembic, migrations, or any database schema.
- Do NOT change auth / RBAC / worker jobs.
- Do NOT delete anything from frontend/ (just read/copy).
- All work is in client/ only, additive-only.

-------------------------------------------------------
B) WHAT YOU MUST DO
-------------------------------------------------------

1) Copy landing components into client/

- From:
  - frontend/src/components/landing/*
- To:
  - client/src/components/landing/*

The components include at least:
Hero, Features, Workflow, AI, Security, KPIs, Integrations, FAQ, Footer, Enterprise (about section).

Adjust imports so they compile correctly inside client/.

2) Copy i18n files into client/

- From:
  - frontend/src/i18n/en.ts
  - frontend/src/i18n/ar.ts
- To:
  - client/src/i18n/en.ts
  - client/src/i18n/ar.ts

Ensure the same keys exist in both languages and fix import paths.

3) Create landing page container

- File: client/src/pages/Landing.tsx
- It should:
  - Import all landing sections from client/src/components/landing/*
  - Render them in order in one scrollable page.
  - Use the i18n strings (no hard-coded text).

4) Implement language switcher (EN / AR)

- Create a small i18n context or hook in client/src (for example client/src/i18n/LanguageProvider.tsx) that:
  - Holds current language ("en" | "ar") in state.
  - Reads from localStorage ("trainflow_lang") on load.
  - Saves to localStorage whenever language changes.
  - Exposes a function to toggle language.

- On language change:
  - Set document.documentElement.dir = "rtl" when lang = "ar", and "ltr" when lang = "en".

- Add a visible language toggle in the landing navbar:
  - For example: "EN | عربي".
  - Clicking it switches language and re-renders all landing sections.

5) Wire the root route `/` to the landing page

- Open client/src/App.tsx (or the main router file).
- Ensure:
  - Route `/` renders <Landing /> for unauthenticated users.
  - Existing dashboard routes (/app/..., /dashboard, etc.) continue to work for authenticated users.
  - The existing auth guard logic remains unchanged.

-------------------------------------------------------
C) ACCEPTANCE CHECKS
-------------------------------------------------------

The session is successful when:

1. client/src/i18n/en.ts and ar.ts exist and compile.
2. client/src/components/landing/* exists and compiles.
3. client/src/pages/Landing.tsx renders all sections (Hero, features grid with 12 items, workflow with 8 steps, AI, KPIs, integrations, security, FAQ, footer).
4. The main router:
   - Shows the new landing on `/` (with EN text by default).
   - Dashboard routes still work as before.
5. A visible language toggle:
   - Switches between EN and AR.
   - Changes page direction (LTR/RTL).
   - Persists the choice in localStorage.
6. The app builds and runs without errors.

At the end, summarize:
- Which files were created/modified in client/.
- How to test:
  - Unauthenticated: open `/` and switch EN/AR.
  - Authenticated: log in with the demo admin and open dashboard, profile, settings, departments.
- Confirm that after republish, training.rocktech.sa will use this new client/ landing.
