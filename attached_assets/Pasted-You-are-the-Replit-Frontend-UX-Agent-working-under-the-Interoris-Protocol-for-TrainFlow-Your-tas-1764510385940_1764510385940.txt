You are the Replit Frontend & UX Agent working under the Interoris Protocol for TrainFlow.

Your task in THIS PHASE ONLY is:

PHASE L – Public Landing Page Upgrade (Bilingual, Enterprise-Grade)

You MUST focus ONLY on the public landing page (home page before login) and its components.
DO NOT modify backend code, database schema, migrations, or authentication.
DO NOT change any API routes.
Frontend-only changes.

====================================================
A. CONSTRAINTS (MUST FOLLOW)
====================================================

- Do NOT touch:
  - backend/ code
  - Alembic migrations
  - Database models
  - Auth / RBAC logic
- Do NOT break existing routing.
- Do NOT introduce any destructive operations.
- Keep all changes additive and backwards-compatible.

Use ONLY the existing frontend stack:
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- TailwindCSS
- ShadCN UI
- Framer Motion
- Zustand (if needed)
- Existing i18n system (frontend/src/i18n/en.ts, ar.ts)

====================================================
B. GOAL – ENTERPRISE LANDING EXPERIENCE
====================================================

The landing page is the main marketing page for TrainFlow:

- Target customers: large enterprises (e.g. Aramco, Saudi Electricity Company, big ministries).
- Product: AI-powered Training, Renewal & Talent Intelligence Platform.

You MUST turn the current simple hero page into a full, polished, enterprise-level landing page with:

1) Strong hero section
2) Detailed feature grid
3) Workflow section
4) AI capabilities section
5) KPI / metrics visualization
6) Integrations section (SAP, Oracle, SuccessFactors, LMS…)
7) Security & compliance section
8) FAQ section
9) Footer with company info
10) Bilingual support (English + Arabic) with RTL

====================================================
C. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
====================================================

1) Landing Entry Component

- Locate the component used for the public home route ("/") before login.
  Example files (adjust to actual paths):
  - frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx
  - frontend/src/components/landing/*

- Confirm this landing page is what renders at the root path when the user is not authenticated.

2) i18n Usage (NO HARDCODED TEXT)

- All text MUST be loaded from i18n:
  - frontend/src/i18n/en.ts
  - frontend/src/i18n/ar.ts

- If needed, define a structured namespace, for example:
  - landing.hero.title
  - landing.hero.subtitle
  - landing.hero.ctaPrimary
  - landing.hero.ctaSecondary
  - landing.features.items[]
  - landing.workflow.steps[]
  - landing.ai.items[]
  - landing.security.points[]
  - landing.integrations.text
  - landing.faq.items[]

- The English and Arabic files MUST have matching keys.
- Do NOT leave any visible text hard-coded in JSX.

3) Hero Section (Top of page)

Requirements:
- Title: “AI-Powered Training, Renewal & Talent Intelligence Platform”
- Subtitle: describe TrainFlow as an enterprise solution designed for companies like Aramco and Saudi Electricity Company (generic positioning, no claims of partnership).
- Two CTAs:
  - Primary: “Get Started” (scrolls to features or opens sign-in/demo)
  - Secondary: “Learn More” (scrolls to workflow/AI section)
- Visual design:
  - Full-width hero
  - Soft gradient background
  - Framer Motion animations (fade-in, slide-up)
  - Icon/badge at top like “⚡ AI-Powered Training Management”
- Bilingual:
  - English + Arabic versions in i18n.
  - When Arabic is active, layout should be RTL and text right-aligned.

4) Features / Core Capabilities Section

- Grid of at least 12 cards (3–4 per row on desktop, 1–2 on mobile).
- Each card: icon + title + short description.
- Capabilities to cover (example list, refine from i18n content):
  - Course validity & renewal tracking
  - Multi-level approval workflow
  - Task & promotion engine
  - KPI dashboards (employee/foreman/manager/training)
  - AI recommendations
  - Grade readiness prediction
  - Skill graph engine
  - Career path AI
  - Security awareness simulator
  - SCORM & LMS integration
  - Enterprise integrations (SAP / Oracle / SuccessFactors)
  - Audit logging & compliance

- Make sure the component supports **12 items** (not just 10).
- Use Tailwind + ShadCN Card with subtle hover animations.

5) Workflow Section

- Visual 8-step workflow that explains the renewal lifecycle, from detection to completion. Example steps:
  1) Course assigned
  2) Expiry detected
  3) Smart alerts sent
  4) Employee requests renewal
  5) Foreman approves
  6) Manager oversight
  7) Training scheduled & completed
  8) KPIs updated

- Each step: icon + title + short line.
- Use Framer Motion to animate steps on scroll.
- Ensure layout/grid supports 8 steps (not 7).

6) AI Capabilities Section

- Show at least 5 AI cards:
  - AI course recommendations
  - Skill gap detection
  - Grade / promotion readiness prediction
  - Weekly coaching suggestions
  - Talent intelligence insights (department / organization level)

- Use modern icons (lucide-react).
- Animated entrance on scroll.
- Fully i18n (EN + AR).

7) KPI / Metrics Section

- 3–4 animated KPI stats:
  - e.g., “+35% faster renewal completion”
  - “90%+ compliance rate”
  - “Reduction in expired courses”
- Use a combination of large numbers + short text.
- Use Framer Motion count-up or simple fade/scale animation.

8) Integrations Section

- Show horizontal strip or grid of logos:
  - SAP, Oracle, SuccessFactors, Cornerstone, generic LMS, SCADA/PI as “future-ready”.
- Text should explain that TrainFlow can integrate with existing HR & LMS systems via APIs.
- Logos can be simple icons (no official brand assets needed, just generic placeholders if required to avoid copyright issues).
- i18n text for this section.

9) Security & Compliance Section

- 4–6 bullet cards covering:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Multi-tenant isolation
  - Audit logging
  - Encryption in transit (HTTPS)
  - SSO / SAML-ready (enterprise mode)
  - ISO 27001 / ISO 9001-friendly architecture

- Use ShadCN components and security / shield icons.
- Bilingual titles + descriptions.

10) FAQ Section

- Accordion (ShadCN/Accordion component).
- At least 6 Q&A items, e.g.:
  - How does TrainFlow connect to our existing ERP/LMS?
  - How long does implementation take?
  - Is AI explainable and controllable?
  - Can it be used by government entities?
  - What about data residency?
  - How are roles and permissions managed?

- Content already exists in i18n; wire the Accordion to that content.

11) Footer

- Include:
  - Product name (TrainFlow)
  - Company name (Rock Technology)
  - Links (Privacy, Terms, Contact)
  - Simple copyright line
- Respect EN/AR translations.

12) Language Switcher & RTL

- Ensure the existing language switcher:
  - Toggles between EN and AR.
  - Saves user choice (e.g., localStorage).
  - Applies `dir="rtl"` for Arabic and `dir="ltr"` for English on the root container (or HTML).
- Test the landing page in BOTH languages and both layouts.

====================================================
D. QUALITY & TESTING
====================================================

Before finishing:

1) In English:
   - Visit root route.
   - Verify hero, features, workflow, AI, KPIs, integrations, security, FAQ and footer all render properly.
   - Ensure there are no missing icons or truncated items.

2) In Arabic:
   - Switch language to AR.
   - Confirm all headings, texts and buttons use the Arabic strings.
   - Confirm layout is RTL and looks visually correct.

3) Mobile & Desktop:
   - Check responsive behavior (small screen vs large).

4) No regression:
   - Do NOT break any dashboard routes or login.
   - Do NOT change any API calls.

Finally, summarize:
- Which files you changed or created.
- How to switch languages and see the full landing page.
- Any limitations left for later phases.
