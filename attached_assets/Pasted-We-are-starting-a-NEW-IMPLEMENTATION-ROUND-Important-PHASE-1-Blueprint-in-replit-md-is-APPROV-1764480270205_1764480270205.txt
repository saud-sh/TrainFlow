We are starting a NEW IMPLEMENTATION ROUND.

Important:
- PHASE 1 – Blueprint in replit.md is APPROVED.
- Some partial Phase 2 work already exists (config.py, enums.py, main.py, security middleware).

In this round, you MUST FOCUS ONLY ON **PHASE 2 – FOUNDATION & SETUP**.  
DO NOT implement Phase 3 or Phase 4 yet.  
Your goal is to COMPLETE Phase 2 100% and then STOP.

====================================================
PHASE 2 – FOUNDATION & SETUP (TO BE COMPLETED NOW)
====================================================

Use the blueprint in replit.md as the source of truth.

SCOPE (INCLUDED):

1) Database Core
- Create `backend/app/db/database.py`:
  - SQLAlchemy engine from `settings.DATABASE_URL`.
  - SessionLocal.
  - Base (declarative).
  - `get_db` dependency.

2) Alembic Migrations
- Add `alembic.ini` at backend root.
- Add `backend/alembic/env.py` wired to SQLAlchemy metadata.
- Add `backend/alembic/versions/001_initial.py`:
  - Create ONLY:
    - `tenants` table
    - `users` table
  - Both tables MUST include:
    - `id` (PK)
    - `tenant_id`
    - audit fields (created_at, updated_at) as per blueprint
  - Migration MUST be additive-only (no drop/alter/drop).

3) Wire FastAPI to DB
- Update `backend/app/main.py`:
  - Ensure DB is initialized.
  - Health endpoints:
    - `/api/health` checks basic app status.
    - `/api/health/detailed` checks DB connectivity by running a simple query.

4) Router Skeletons
- Create empty router modules according to the blueprint:
  - `backend/app/api/v1/users.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/departments.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/courses.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/enrollments.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/renewals.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/tasks.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/kpi.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/notifications.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/ai.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/integrations.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/audit.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/scorm.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/security_awareness.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/skills.py`
  - `backend/app/api/v1/career.py`
- Register all these routers in `main.py` with correct prefixes but keep handlers as simple placeholders (e.g. “return {'status': 'ok'}”).

5) Frontend Bootstrapping
- Initialize the React/Vite/TypeScript app under `frontend/` as per blueprint.
- Configure TailwindCSS.
- Install ShadCN UI.
- Create:
  - `src/App.tsx` with basic layout.
  - `src/main.tsx`.
  - Router with two routes:
    - `/login` (placeholder page)
    - `/` (Dashboard placeholder).
- Create Axios API client file pointing to backend `/api`.
- Create basic Zustand store folder with:
  - `authStore` skeleton.

OUT OF SCOPE (MUST NOT DO IN THIS ROUND):
- No business models (courses, enrollments, etc.) beyond tenants/users.
- No authentication logic yet (just placeholders).
- No RBAC logic yet.
- No background jobs.
- No AI implementation.
- No seed data.
- No integration with SendGrid yet.

CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT modify or drop existing tables.
- DO NOT start implementing Phase 3 or Phase 4.
- Respect tenant_id in the initial tables (tenants & users).
- Follow the folder structure defined in replit.md.

DELIVERABLES BY END OF THIS ROUND:
- Backend:
  - FastAPI app starts successfully.
  - `/api/health` and `/api/health/detailed` work and confirm DB connectivity.
  - Alembic is configured and `alembic upgrade head` works, creating `tenants` and `users`.
- Frontend:
  - `npm install` / `pnpm install` works.
  - `npm run dev` starts the React app with `/` and `/login` pages.
- Documentation:
  - Update replit.md or a short note explaining how to:
    - Run Alembic migrations.
    - Start backend.
    - Start frontend.

After completing Phase 2:
- STOP.
- Summarize exactly what you did.
- DO NOT attempt Phase 3 or Phase 4 until I explicitly request them.
